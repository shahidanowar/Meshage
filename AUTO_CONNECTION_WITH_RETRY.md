# Automatic Connection with Retry Logic

## Overview
The app now **automatically connects to all nearby devices** without any user interaction. If a connection fails, it automatically retries until successful.

## What Changed

### **Before:**
- User had to tap "Auto-Connect" toggle to enable
- Toggle could be turned off
- No retry on connection failure
- Manual intervention needed if connection failed

### **After:**
- **Always auto-connects** (no toggle)
- Connects to ALL available peers automatically
- **Automatic retry** if connection fails
- Retries every 5 seconds until successful
- No user interaction needed

## How It Works

### **1. Automatic Discovery**
```
App Opens ‚Üí Requests Permissions ‚Üí Auto-starts Discovery
```

### **2. Peer Detection**
```
Peer Found ‚Üí Status "Available" ‚Üí Immediately Connect
```

### **3. Connection Retry Logic**
```
Connection Attempt ‚Üí Wait 5 seconds ‚Üí Check if Connected
                                             ‚Üì
                                           No? ‚Üí Retry
                                             ‚Üì
                                          Yes? ‚Üí Stop Retrying
```

### **4. Multiple Peers**
```
Peer 1 Found ‚Üí Auto-connect to Peer 1
Peer 2 Found ‚Üí Auto-connect to Peer 2  (simultaneously)
Peer 3 Found ‚Üí Auto-connect to Peer 3
...
```

## Code Implementation

### **State Variables**
```typescript
// Track connection attempts per peer
const connectionAttempts = useRef<Map<string, number>>(new Map());

// Track retry timers for each peer
const connectionRetryTimers = useRef<Map<string, any>>(new Map());
```

### **Connection Attempt Function**
```typescript
const attemptConnection = (peer: Peer) => {
  const attempts = connectionAttempts.current.get(peer.deviceAddress) || 0;
  
  if (!connectedPeers.includes(peer.deviceAddress)) {
    console.log(`Auto-connecting to: ${peer.deviceName} (attempt ${attempts + 1})`);
    MeshNetwork.connectToPeer(peer.deviceAddress);
    connectionAttempts.current.set(peer.deviceAddress, attempts + 1);
    
    // Set retry timer (retry after 5 seconds if connection fails)
    const retryTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Check if still not connected and peer still available
      if (!connectedPeers.includes(peer.deviceAddress) && 
          peers.some(p => p.deviceAddress === peer.deviceAddress && p.status === 3)) {
        attemptConnection(peer); // Recursive retry
      }
    }, 5000);
    
    connectionRetryTimers.current.set(peer.deviceAddress, retryTimer);
  }
};
```

### **On Peers Found**
```typescript
const onPeersFoundListener = MeshNetworkEvents.addListener(
  'onPeersFound',
  (event: Peer[]) => {
    setPeers(event);
    
    // Auto-connect to ALL available peers
    event.forEach((peer: Peer) => {
      if (peer.status === 3 && !connectedPeers.includes(peer.deviceAddress)) {
        attemptConnection(peer);
      }
    });
  },
);
```

### **On Peer Connected (Cleanup)**
```typescript
const onPeerConnectedListener = MeshNetworkEvents.addListener(
  'onPeerConnected',
  (address: string) => {
    setConnectedPeers(prev => [...new Set([...prev, address])]);
    
    // Clear retry timer since connection succeeded
    const timer = connectionRetryTimers.current.get(address);
    if (timer) {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      connectionRetryTimers.current.delete(address);
    }
    // Reset connection attempts
    connectionAttempts.current.delete(address);
  },
);
```

## Features

### **‚úÖ Zero-Touch Connection**
- No buttons to tap
- No toggles to enable
- Works automatically in background

### **‚úÖ Retry on Failure**
- Connection failed? Retries automatically
- Keeps trying every 5 seconds
- Stops when connection succeeds

### **‚úÖ Multi-Peer Support**
- Connects to multiple peers simultaneously
- Each peer has independent retry logic
- No limit on number of connections

### **‚úÖ Smart Cleanup**
- Timers cleared when connection succeeds
- Timers cleared when peer goes out of range
- No memory leaks

### **‚úÖ Resource Efficient**
- Only retries if peer is still available
- Stops retrying if peer disconnects
- Clears all timers on unmount

## User Experience Flow

### **Scenario 1: Normal Connection**
```
1. User opens app
2. Discovery starts automatically
3. Peer found: "Bob"
4. App connects to Bob automatically
5. Connection succeeds
6. User can chat immediately
```

### **Scenario 2: Connection Failure with Retry**
```
1. User opens app
2. Discovery starts
3. Peer found: "Bob"
4. App tries to connect to Bob
5. Connection fails (network issue)
6. Wait 5 seconds...
7. App retries connection to Bob
8. Connection succeeds
9. User can chat
```

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Peers**
```
1. User opens app
2. Discovery starts
3. Peer found: "Bob" ‚Üí Auto-connect
4. Peer found: "Charlie" ‚Üí Auto-connect
5. Peer found: "Alice" ‚Üí Auto-connect
6. All 3 connections succeed
7. User can chat with all 3 simultaneously
```

### **Scenario 4: Peer Goes Out of Range**
```
1. Peer found: "Bob"
2. Connection attempt started
3. Bob moves out of range
4. Connection fails
5. Wait 5 seconds...
6. Check if Bob still available
7. Bob not in peer list ‚Üí Stop retrying
8. No more connection attempts
```

## Configuration

### **Retry Interval (Default: 5 seconds)**
```typescript
const retryTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  attemptConnection(peer);
}, 5000); // Change to 3000 for 3 seconds, etc.
```

### **Max Retry Attempts (Currently: Unlimited)**
To add max retries:
```typescript
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5;
const attempts = connectionAttempts.current.get(peer.deviceAddress) || 0;

if (attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {
  // Retry
  attemptConnection(peer);
} else {
  console.log(`Max retry attempts reached for ${peer.deviceName}`);
}
```

### **Exponential Backoff**
To increase delay with each retry:
```typescript
const attempts = connectionAttempts.current.get(peer.deviceAddress) || 0;
const delay = Math.min(5000 * Math.pow(2, attempts), 30000); // Max 30 sec

const retryTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  attemptConnection(peer);
}, delay);
```

## Console Logs

You'll see logs like:
```
Auto-connecting to: Bob (attempt 1)
Peer connected: endpoint_123
‚úì Connection succeeded

Auto-connecting to: Charlie (attempt 1)
Connection failed
Retrying connection to: Charlie
Auto-connecting to: Charlie (attempt 2)
Peer connected: endpoint_456
‚úì Connection succeeded
```

## UI Changes

### **Removed:**
- ‚ùå Auto-Connect toggle switch
- ‚ùå "Auto-Connect" label
- ‚ùå Toggle state management

### **Kept:**
- ‚úÖ Peer list modal
- ‚úÖ Chat interface
- ‚úÖ Status updates
- ‚úÖ Connect button (for manual override if needed)

## Testing

### **Test Auto-Connection:**
1. Install on 2 devices
2. Open app on Device 1
3. Open app on Device 2
4. Wait 2-3 seconds
5. Both should connect automatically
6. No button taps needed

### **Test Retry Logic:**
1. Open app on Device 1
2. Turn on Airplane mode on Device 2
3. Open app on Device 2 (will find Device 1)
4. Connection will fail
5. Turn off Airplane mode
6. Wait 5 seconds
7. Connection should retry and succeed

### **Test Multiple Peers:**
1. Install on 3+ devices
2. Open app on all devices
3. All should discover each other
4. All should connect automatically
5. Check peer modal shows all as connected

## Troubleshooting

**Connections not happening:**
- Check permissions are granted
- Ensure WiFi/Bluetooth is enabled
- Check devices are in range

**Constant retries:**
- Check if peers are actually connectable
- May indicate network issues
- Consider adding max retry limit

**Memory concerns:**
- Timers are cleaned up properly
- No memory leaks in current implementation
- All timers cleared on unmount

## Future Enhancements

1. **Connection Priority** - Connect to strongest signal first
2. **Max Retry Limit** - Stop after N attempts
3. **Exponential Backoff** - Increase delay with each retry
4. **Connection Quality** - Display signal strength
5. **Smart Reconnect** - Remember previously connected peers
6. **Bandwidth Optimization** - Limit concurrent connections
